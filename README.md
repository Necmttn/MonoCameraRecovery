ABSTRACT
========
Most applications require stereo cameras in order to recover 3D information of a scene. However, using information such as the intrinsic properties of the camera and the real-world coordinates of an object, it is possible to recover the 3D information from an image of the given object taken by a single camera. In this paper, a Python-OpenCV application for recovering 3D information with a single camera has been created. The application takes input from a single webcam and tracks a square in the scene. After detecting the corners of the square, the recovery algorithm is applied to recover the 3D information.

Keywords - 3D information, mono-camera, Python, OpenCV
